# CoreNote
CoreNote is an open-source planning software desktop app and a long-term project of mine. At the moment, it is in early development and lacks many features, including compatibility with other devices.

I chose to develop a simple offline planning software type application because of how useful I found other To Do apps to be.

It is built with the Qt Python binding, PySide 6 and coded in Python.

## Planned features include:
> - A main window where the user can navigate the application.
> - The ability to create, view, delete and edit tasks.
> - A calendar for any given month

More TBA :)
